# 🚀 Day 1 — GCP Foundations (Cloud + IAM + Project + Regions/Zones)

## ⭐ Overview
Day 1 is focused on learning the essential foundation required for any Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or SRE.

# 1️⃣ What is Cloud?
Cloud means renting computing resources instead of buying physical servers.

### On-Premise Limitations:
- High cost  
- Hardware maintenance  
- Slow scaling  
- Manual upgrades  

### Cloud Advantages:
- Create servers in seconds  
- Fast global scalability  
- No physical maintenance  
- Pay only for what you use  
- Highly available and secure  

---

# 2️⃣ Why GCP?
GCP is preferred due to:
- Strong global network backbone  
- SRE-driven architecture  
- Best IAM security  
- Easy automation  
- Cost-effective servers  
- GKE (best Kubernetes platform)  
- BigQuery (fastest analytics engine)

---

# 3️⃣ GCP Project (Your Main Workspace)
A project contains:
- VM Instances  
- VPC Networks  
- Subnets  
- Firewall Rules  
- Buckets  
- BigQuery datasets  
- APIs & Billing  
- Service Accounts  

Every action happens **inside a project**.

---

# 4️⃣ IAM (Identity & Access Management)

IAM defines:
- **Who** can access  
- **What** resources  
- **What actions** they can perform  

### IAM Components:
- **Users / Members**
- **Roles**
  - Owner
  - Editor
  - Viewer
- **Predefined Roles** (Compute Admin, Storage Admin, Network Admin)
- **Custom Roles**
- **Policies**

IAM is the most important part of GCP security.

# 5️⃣ Regions & Zones

### Region:
A geographical location  
Example:  
- asia-south1 (Mumbai)  
- us-central1 (Iowa)

### Zone:
A datacenter within a region  
Example:  
- asia-south1-a  
- asia-south1-b  
- asia-south1-c  

Zones = High availability

# 6️⃣ Compute Engine (VM Instances)

VM features:
- Machine types (E2, N2, C2)
- Public / Private IP
- Boot disk
- Firewall rules
- Metadata
- Snapshots / Images
- Service accounts

---

# 7️⃣ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
GCP's networking platform.

Includes:
- Subnets  
- IP ranges  
- Routes  
- Firewalls  
- NAT  
- VPC Peering  

Your networking background gives a strong advantage here.

---

# 8️⃣ Cloud Shell
A browser-based Linux environment with:
- gcloud CLI  
- Terraform support  
- Git installed  
- 5GB persistent home directory  

Used by SRE/DevOps for automation and deployments.

# 📌 Day 1 Summary
- Learned Cloud basics  
- Understood Projects & IAM  
- Explored Regions/Zones  
- Viewed Compute Engine & VPC  
- Started Cloud Shell  
- Prepared for Day 2 hands-on VM creation
